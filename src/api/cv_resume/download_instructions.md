The error message indicates that WeasyPrint is unable to locate some required libraries, specifically `gobject-2.0-0`. This is a common issue when setting up WeasyPrint on Windows due to the need for several additional dependencies.

Here's how you can address this issue on Windows:

### Step 1: Install GTK3 for Windows

WeasyPrint relies on GTK3 libraries, which need to be installed manually on Windows. Follow these steps to install GTK3:

1. **Download GTK3 Runtime**:
   - Visit the [GTK3 for Windows](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases) release page.
   - Download the `gtk3-runtime-<version>.exe` installer (choose the latest version).

2. **Install GTK3 Runtime**:
   - Run the downloaded installer.
   - During installation, select the option to "Set up environment variables" to ensure the library paths are added to your system's PATH.

### Step 2: Install Additional Dependencies

You also need some additional libraries that can be installed using MSYS2.

1. **Install MSYS2**:
   - Download the MSYS2 installer from the [MSYS2 website](https://www.msys2.org/).
   - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Update MSYS2 and Install Libraries**:
   - Open the MSYS2 MSYS terminal from the Start menu.
   - Update the package database and core system packages:
     ```sh
     pacman -Syu
     ```
   - Close the terminal and open it again (to ensure all updates are applied).
   - Install the required libraries:
     ```sh
     pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3 mingw-w64-x86_64-cairo mingw-w64-x86_64-pango mingw-w64-x86_64-gdk-pixbuf2
     ```

### Step 3: Install WeasyPrint Using pip

Ensure you have `pip` installed for Python. If not, you can install it using:

```sh
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

Then, install WeasyPrint using pip:

```sh
pip install WeasyPrint
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

To verify that WeasyPrint is installed correctly, you can run a simple test script. Create a file called `test_weasyprint.py` with the following content:

```python
from weasyprint import HTML

HTML(string='<h1>Hello, WeasyPrint!</h1>').write_pdf('hello.pdf')
```

Then run the script:

```sh
python test_weasyprint.py
```

This should generate a `hello.pdf` file in the current directory with the content "Hello, WeasyPrint!".

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the library loading issues and successfully use WeasyPrint on Windows. If you encounter further issues, please refer to the [WeasyPrint documentation](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html#installation) for additional troubleshooting tips.
